// Check if the user is authenticated (logged in).
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    // Redirect to the login page or display an error message.
    header('Location: login.php');

// Check if the form has been submitted.
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['submit_payment'])) {

    $payment_method = $_POST['payment_method'];
    $total_cost = $_POST['total_cost'];

    // Process the payment using your preferred payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
    // You will need to integrate with the actual payment gateway here.

    // Assuming the payment is successful, update the order status to reflect payment submission.
    // You can update the database records accordingly.
    // For example, set the status of the order to "Payment Received."

    // After payment processing, generate an order confirmation and send it to the user via email.

    // Redirect the user to a confirmation page.
    header('Location: payment_confirmation.php');
    exit();
}

// Display the checkout page with the order summary.
